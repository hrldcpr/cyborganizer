=BUGS=
*offline issues...

*overcome maximum zoom
	max div height seems to be c.170,000px
	could do 4-ary tree, so can describe location of things by branchings,
		as e.g. '011032011' and '011031',
		and sort lexicographically by key
	but anything that involves creating and destroying DOM elements is bad...
		unless it is a rare occurrence, i.e. quadrant is only renewed when height is nearing the limit.

*asynchronize
	use cacheDB synchronously, and asynchronously flush it?
	jquery.couch.js is supposedly asynchronous, but it's not so great
	just roll my own asynchronous cacheDB with $.ajax()

*scrolling speed varies in different browsers
	
*non-fixed resizing
	(which has been disabled for now)
	doesn't work perfectly in the first place
	and doesn't update the font size

*offline images
	db attachments? (seems unnecessary when online)
	localStorage?
	applicationCache?
	
*way to turn off background image

*fix mobile rounded image corners

*setTimeout for flush -- 'online' event less useful on iPhone

*somehow reshaping on iPhone can give null geometry values?


=FEATURES=
*cleverer zooming
	one click zooms to size A, which is size where making a new object will be of same size as clicked object
	another click zooms to size B, which is good for interacting with editor UI
	another click zooms back to size A, et cetera...
	perhaps editor is only displayed at size B?

*color picker

*list view

*search

*google image search
	supposedly aol image search is actually google?
